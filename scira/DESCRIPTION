Package: scira
Title: Scalable Inference of Regulatory Activity
Version: 0.9.1
Description: scira is an R package designed to obtain transcription factor regulatory activity estimates of tissue-specific transcription factors in single-cell RNA-Seq data. It is a tissue-centric approach, which first builds a tissue-specific regulatory network, consisting of tissue-specific transcription factors plus their associated regulons. Using these regulons, scira can then estimate corresponding regulatory activity in single-cells, and may be specially useful in the context of a high dropout rate. scira is aimed at identifying tissue-specific regulatory factors that are disrupted in cancer, preneoplastic lesions or in normal cells exposed to disease risk factors.
